Solidity is the most popular smart contract development language at the time of writing, while Foundry is gradually approaching the same position as a smart contract development framework. 

This [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) will start from *hello world*, and will increase in complexity, as is the case with other books that teach a programming language.
I will try to include Foundry tests for each section, wherever it makes sense.

This project is an inspired twist on other sources of learning Solidity.

To follow along, I highly recommend that you install [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry "Foundry") on your system.
The exact installation instructions might vary depending on your system, but the [Foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/ "Foundry book") is quite comprehensive.

You can also use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/ "Remix") for an interactive UI to interact with your smart contracts, although I'll be using Foundry throughout.
