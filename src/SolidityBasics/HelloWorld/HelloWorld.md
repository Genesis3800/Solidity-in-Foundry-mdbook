# Hello World

Before getting started with our first contract, let us set up the diectory structure I will be following throughout the book.
As I said before, we will be storing all our code within the src directory.

1. Create a directory called `SolidityBasics` inside `src`.
This directory will contain all the chapters that deal with basic Solidity Syntax.
2. Create another directory called `HelloWorld` inside `SolidityBasics`.
This directory will contain all the code related to the Hello World contract. Each chapter will have its own directory.
3. Create a file called `HelloWorld.sol` inside `HelloWorld`.

Your directory structure should look something like this:


```sh
├── src/
│ ├── SolidityBasics/
│ │ ├── HelloWorld/
| | │ ├── HelloWorld.sol
│ │ │ └── HelloWorld.t.sol
```

You are now ready to write your first smart contract in Solidity, and learn about what all goes inside a bare-bones smart contract.
